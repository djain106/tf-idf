# Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency Algorithm
This was a class project that focused on implementing the TF-IDF algorithm efficiently on a number of text files. To search with this code, it is important to have the text files written in the following format:
```
Line 1: {URL}
Line 2: {AUTHOR}
Line 3: {TITLE}
Line 4...N: {DOCUMENT TEXT}
```

To run the code, place all text files within the same directory as the tf-idf.py file and run with ```py tf-idf.py``` and answer relevant questions to your search. User can select
number of files that should be retrieved from the search algorithm.
